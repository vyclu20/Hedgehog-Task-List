# Hedgehog-Task-List
Project was last updated on: 1 April 2023

**This was a little program I made for fun. I thought it was pretty cute**

All graphics (except for the add task banner) are from the game [Hananezumi](https://www.hananezumi.com/?l=en)

Hananezumi is a mobile game that involves sowing seeds in a garden and decorating it with various items. The game features hedgehogs that come to the garden and consume the seeds that the player has planted, which causes flowers to grow and be collected

## Program Information

This is a code for a To-Do List web application that allows users to add tasks and move them between a "To-Do" list and a "Done" list. It includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

This simple program enables users to input tasks via an input bar, which are then added to a to-do list. Completed tasks can be moved to the done list, while a reset button is available to remove all tasks from both lists. Moving one item to another list and clicking any button will also have a click sound.

**A basic rundown of how it works**

> The HTML document includes a text input field for adding tasks, two lists for showing tasks that are to be done and tasks that are completed, and buttons for adding tasks, resetting the lists, and playing a sound effect.

> The CSS styling includes background images for the two list containers and the top task input container, as well as some custom styling for list items, buttons, and other elements.

> The JavaScript code defines variables for the task input field, the two lists, the reset button, and the sound effect, as well as several functions for adding and moving tasks, handling button clicks and key presses, and playing the sound effect.

The layout is a bit empty since I couldn't really think of anything else to put around. I was going to have some confetti fall down in the background anytime the reset button is clicked, but I couldn't find any graphics I liked enough to put in the code. So maybe one day lol

All the sound effects and images used are included in this repository!
